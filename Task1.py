           Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:

1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
"""

n1=float(input('Enter the first number: '))
n2=float(input('Enter the second number: '))

#2. Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:

# Addition

print("Addition:", n1+n2)

#Subtraction

print("Subtraction:", n1-n2)

#Multiplication

print("Multiplication:", n1*n2)

#Division

print("Division:", n1/n2)
