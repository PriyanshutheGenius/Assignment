                 Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

           Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:

1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
"""

n1: str=input('Enter the first number: ')
n2=input('Enter the second number: ')

#2. Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:

# Addition

a=16
b=30
print(a+b)

#Subtraction

c=80
d=35
print(c-d)

#Multiplication

e=18
f=95
print(e*f)

#Division

g=38
h=2
print(g/h)
